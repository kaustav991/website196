                        <h3>Competitive splits and compensation</h3>
                        <p>With competitive splits and top tier compensation, we want to ensure that our brokers are treated honestly and fairly. We pay out our all finders fees and volume bonuses received for completed files. As a new to the industry broker, you will start off with a 70/30 split and increase as you grow as a mortgage professional. As a seasoned broker your split will depend on your current volumes, efficiencies, and lender references. We do not have any file compliance fees, or any other hidden costs. All costs and fees will be discussed with you up front.</p>
                        <p>We want you to be here because you want to be here, and not because you have to due to a legal obligation. We do not have any long term commitment periods with our brokers. Feel free to also use images from the onedrive link powerpoint or any other image that seems fitting.</p>
